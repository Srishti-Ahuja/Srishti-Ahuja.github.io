                <p>First and the most important step in development process is coming 
                    up with an idea. Acquiring all the skills in the world won’t help 
                    you if your idea is not good enough. While finalizing an idea to 
                    work upon, be sure to identify is it has some practical application.</p>

                <h2>2.	Gather information </h2>
                <p>Most people ignore this crucial step in the development process. 
                    To ensure that you are on the right path, gathering information 
                    is necessary. Know your goals. Who is the site for? What do they 
                    expect to find or do there? Research about your target audience. 
                    Are the audience teenagers or children or adults? Building clarity
                     of what you intend to make will help to stay on the right path.</p>

                <h2>3.	Planning</h2>
                <p>Once you have gathered sufficient information you can start 
                    planning what your site will look like. This can be done by 
                    creating sitemaps and wireframe. A sitemap is made with the 
                    information collected in the first stage. The primary motive of a 
                    site map is to create a website user-friendly and create a structure
                     of a site. A wireframe provides a visual description of a site. 
                     Plan what functions and features you want to incorporate in your 
                     site.</p>

                <h2>4.	Design</h2>
                <p>Design is essential for attracting the target audience. It is 
                    created according to the audience’s preferences. A website that 
                    you are designing for school is entirely different than what you 
                    are designing for goods. The theme, colour contrast, where to place
                    text, images and videos comes under design layout. Designing will 
                    help you present the content in a structured and presentable manner. 
                    Designers generally incorporate various elements such as company 
                    logo, color that strengthens brand identity, a theme that reflects the 
                    company’s product portfolio, and layout that is elegant and looks 
                    appealing.</p>

                <h2>5.	Content writing </h2>
                <p>Content should be tactfully created so as to grab the user’s attention. 
                    It is important that the content on your site is simple to understand 
                    and engaging. Meaningful headings, subheadings, tags, etc. should be 
                    used so that people can find what they are searching.</p>

                <h2>6.	Development</h2>
                <p>This is where the actual coding begins. It is the most crucial 
                    step in development as the entire planning and design comes to life 
                    in this step. As per sitemaps, a home page is first designed than the 
                    other pages. Here, you finally start making the website. Other elements 
                    designed in the previous steps are utilized to create an actual web 
                    design.</p>

                <h2>7.	Testing</h2>
                <p>All pages and links are tested before launching the site to make sure 
                    nothing is broken. Check every form, script, and run spelling check 
                    software so as to find possible typing errors. Use code validators to 
                    make sure if your code follows the current web development standards. 
                    In this stage, your site is tested for several things including- 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Website speed</li>
                        <li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>

                <p>Now that everything is set, it is time to launch the website. This is the big 
                    day when our project is open for others. However this is not the last step in Web 
                    Development. The developer’s job is not done yet. The developer should now work

                <h2>9.	Marketing</h2>
                <p>Once your website is published you need to appropriately promote it. 
                    The practice of creation and improving content to rank well in search 
                    is known as search engine optimization, or SEO. Content that’s well-written, 
                    informative, and keyword-rich is more easily picked up by search engines, 
                    all of which helps to make the site easier to find. Also, one can introduce their product 
                    to the world via your social channels like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc. 
                    Don’t forget to highlight in your newsletter, advertisements etc. and let 
                    your customers or prospects know.</p>
