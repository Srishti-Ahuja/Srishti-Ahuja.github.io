        <h2>What are client-side and server-side?</h2>
        <p>Client-side and server-side are web development terms that describe 
            where application code runs. Web developers will also refer to this 
            distinction as the frontend vs. the backend, although client-side/
            server-side and frontend/backend aren't quite the same</p>

        <h2>Front End Development</h2>
        <p>The part of a website that user interacts with directly is termed as 
            front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the 
            application. It includes everything that users experience directly: 
            text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, 
            and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the languages used 
            for Front End development. The structure, design, behavior, and content 
            of everything seen on browser screen when websites, web applications, 
            or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented by front End developers.</p>

    <td><div class="end">
        <h2>Back End Development</h2>
        <p>Backend is server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, 
            and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website 
            works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and 
            interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in 
            direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed 
            by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-
            end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, 
            and working with system components without user interfaces or even 
            systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.</p>
